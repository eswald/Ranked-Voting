r'''Ranked voting methods.
    Each method here is a function with two parameters:
        `votes` - A sequence of tuples.
            The first item is a list of candidate keys in ranked order;
            each item may be a tuple to indicate equal rankings.
            The second item is the number of times this sequence appears.
        `candidates` - A sequence of candidate keys.
            Keys in the vote rankings that don't appear in this list will be ignored.
